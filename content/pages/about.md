I grew up in Ottawa, Canada. I have fond memories of art school. This is not to say life at that time was easy, it felt confusing until in my third and last year, my research started producing some interesting forms, under the influence of Raymonde April, mostly. Other larger than life teachers were Geoffrey James, Lynne Cohen, Charles Gagnon, Tony Brown, René Payant, Thierry De Duve. At the time, I couldn’t appreciate the tenor of artists and thinkers employed by the VA dept at U of O., but I look back on that time with great admiration for what I learned from them: a certain physical feeling when their words resonated with me, whether it was Geoffrey James talking about Eugene Atget’s trees, or Raymonde April’s excitement when I showed her a piece I had just completed consisting in a series of stills with text in a grid. The excitement I felt in that moment of having connected with her over that particular piece left a deep impression that I have tried since to recapture, and sublimate. 

In the early 80’s, the visual arts department at the University of Ottawa was divided into three areas: painting & sculpture, photography and theory, and each program had its own physical space and equipments and teaching staff. I spent most of my time in the basement darkrooms processing and printing film. I remember the rat and the bat. What a fright. But it was also a period of self-discovery, looking for the group, but instead finding some great individuals such as my friend Valerie Pocock now Behiery, Paul Ahad, and others. I also remember the heartbreaks.

Since then, I have meandered from job to job until re-entering the art world in the early 90’s working at Artexte, an information centre on Canadian contemporary art, another great school where I experienced workplace politics while learning about arts admin, cataloguing & indexing. I stumbled into Skol in 2004 where I stayed for 8 years, until 2012. During my tenure at SKOL, I was honoured to support the development of the Apprendre/Learn program, and curated projects such as the Unknown Artist, the Erratic School, Teasing the Furtive, Embracing the Archive, and Promiscuous Infrastructures in addition to numerous gallery exhibitions and activities.

I left Skol when I was hired by ARCA, a federation of artist-run centres associations from across Canada where I completed two four-year terms until August 2020. During that time, I got to travel across Canada and visit all the centres and meet the people and produce some resources and attend many meetings with peers in the sector.

I’m now on my own, working on some modest art projects while developing a communication’s service at AGAVF, under the mentorship of their director, Lise Leblanc. And, I’m so grateful for all the teachings over the years that I can now synthesize, and valorize by sharing.

Whether under Unregistered Concept or Outsider from Within, two transient identities created for the exploration of furtive artistic production and dissemination, I continue to produce whimsical assemblages composed of many parts of post-production materials collected from everyday life and chosen for their forms, colours and rhythmic motifs.
