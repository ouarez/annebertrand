Urban Occupation consists in the furtive install of 21 plasticized ornemental tiles made from gifted cast-off bristol board and recycled peach wrappers. The tiles were installed in 3 different locations, two along the Lachine Canal and one under the Bonaventure highway, as part of, and slightly outside of, a group exhibition held outdoors in Griffintown.
